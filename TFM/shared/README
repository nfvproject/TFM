===== OVERVIEW ==============================================================
This README provides inforamtion about the OpenNF Shared Library. See the 
OpenNF website (http://opennf.cs.wisc.edu) for other OpenNF code and research
publications.

===== LICENSE ===============================================================
See the LICENSE file.

===== COMPILATION ===========================================================
1) Install the necessary libraries and compilation tools:
    - gcc
    - cmake
    - Pthread library
    - JSON-C library

2) Run "make install"

By default, the library, header file, and configuration file will be 
installed in "/usr/local/lib", "/usr/local/include", and "/usr/local/etc", 
respectively. You can change the install location to something other than 
"/usr/local" by setting the environment variable "PREFIX" to the desired path.

===== CONFIGURATION =========================================================
The OpenNF shared library reads a configuration file to determine the IP
address and ports to use to connect to the OpenNF controller. By default, the
configuration file is located at "/usr/local/etc/sdmbn.conf". 

The configuration file specifies the following:
    - ctrl_ip -- the IP address of the OpenNF controller
    - ctrl_port_state -- the port to use for the state socket connection;
        this should match the state port specified in the controller
        configuration
    - ctrl_port_event -- the port to use for the event socket connection;
        this should match the event port specified in the controller
        configuration
    - release_get_pkts -- this specifies whether the shared library should
        wait to handle any getPerflow calls until at least a minimum number
        of packets have been received; a value of -1 implies no waiting
        should occur; a positive integer indicates the NF should have
        recenved at least that many packets before handling a getPerflow
        call; this option is primarily used to testing and benchmarking
    - release_get_flows -- same as the "release_get_pkts" option, except this
        is used to specify the number of active flows that should be present
        before a getPerflow call is processed; if both release_get_pkts and
        release_get_flows are set to positive integers, then a pending
        getPerflow call will be processed as soon as one of the two
        thresholds is reached

===== RUN ===================================================================
The shared library is linked into NFs and not run by itself.
